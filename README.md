# Aim

To develop a Stopwatch Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to Start, Pause, and Reset time, displaying it in the format MM : SS : MS and updating dynamically without page refresh.

# Procedure

### HTML Implementation

Add a container to display the stopwatch time.

Add Start, Pause, and Reset buttons.

Link the external CSS and JS files.

### CSS Styling

Style the body with a centered layout.

Design the stopwatch display with background, padding, and rounded corners.

Style buttons with hover effects and disabled states.

### JavaScript Logic

Declare variables for minutes, seconds, milliseconds.

Implement updateDisplay() to update the time dynamically.

Create functions:

startStopwatch() → Starts counting time using setInterval().

pauseStopwatch() → Pauses the timer by clearing the interval.

resetStopwatch() → Resets all values to zero and updates display.

Add event listeners to Start, Pause, and Reset buttons.

Test Start, Pause, and Reset functionalities.
